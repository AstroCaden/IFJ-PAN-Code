# IFJ-PAN-Code
Code I wrote during my time at the IFJ PAN in Krakow, as part of my intership project.


Code is self-written, however, it is important to note that some part of the code were passed through AI tools for bug fixing, restructuring and clean-up. All physical modelling, algorithm design and the implementation of this is my own work. Though, the AI refactoring may have unintentionally rewritten segments of the code, to no impact on the underlying scientific content.
